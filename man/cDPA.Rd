\description{A constrained dynamic programming algorithm (cDPA) can be used to
compute the best segmentation with respect to the Poisson
likelihood, subject to a constraint on the number of segments, and
the changes which must alternate: up, down, up, down, ...}
\usage{cDPA(count, weight = rep(1, 
    length(count)), maxSegments)}
\arguments{
  \item{count}{Integer vector of \code{count} data to segment.}
  \item{weight}{Data weights (normally this is the number of base pairs).}
  \item{maxSegments}{Maximum number of segments to consider.}
}
