Title: Dynamic Programming Algorithm for Peak Detection in ChIP-Seq Data
Description: A quadratic time dynamic programming algorithm
 can be used to compute an approximate solution to the problem of
 finding the most likely changepoints
 with respect to the Poisson likelihood, subject
 to a constraint on the number of segments, and the changes which must
 alternate: up, down, up, down, etc. For more info read

 for peak detection in count data" by TD Hocking et al,
 proceedings of ICML2015.
